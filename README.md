# KMS-Net-Kolmogorov-Arnold-Based-Multi-Scale-Attention-Network-for-Cardiac-Image-Segmentation
KMT-Net is a hybrid cardiac image segmentation model combining Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks, multi-scale attention, and state-space layers to capture both local detail and global context. It achieves state-of-the-art results on CAMUS and ACDC, shows strong zero-shot generalization to EchoNet-Dynamic, and the full code will be publicly available on GitHub upon publication.
